Greetings my name is Jonathan Silva, I am 24 years old and I am a rabid gaming fanatic. It all began when I was a child and was gifted a Nintendo 64, with Mario 64. Being my first game, I remember falling in love with its imaginative world while getting lost in an environment that was more abstract than my own. Challenges that were impossible to me at such a young age became easier and more obtainable as I practiced and grew older. Personally, I believe gaming to be some of the more fulfilling hobbies as most games all provide an interesting world with various challenges that become much more satisfying once completed by the user.


If you have never tried gaming before  I definitely recommend it and will provide a walkthrough for how to set up your first console! The most  important step is to buy a console or a PC, which will be the machine used to play your game. For the second step it is important to plug in your device to both your outlet as well as your television using the HDMI cable that came included with it. Once you plug in your chosen device for gaming you should also make sure your device is connected to the internet using an ethernet cable or simply by using your wifi. Once your device is connected to the internet and your television the last step is to take your chosen game disk and place it in the disk drive. That is all you need to start your gaming journey.


Within the last decade it has become possible to play games on your mobile devices such as your smartphones and tablets, making gaming much more accessible to people who are unable to afford a new console. Also as gaming has become more universally used with the internet, we are now able to download games onto your hard drive without the need of actually owning a physical copy of a game. While internet isnâ€™t exactly required for a great single player experience, if you wish to play multiplayer games online it is important to have a strong connection to the internet to do so. Games like Call of Duty, Fifa, and even Minecraft all require an internet connection if you wish to play online with your friends. Finally if you ever find yourself stuck on a challenging mission, chances are there are many other people who have also encountered this same problem. As a result there is a nearly infinite amount of internet walkthroughs that are designed for new players who are having difficulties in a particular game.
